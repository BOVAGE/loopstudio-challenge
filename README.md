## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned more about grid especially some grid property value I didn't know of before.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-rows: max-content;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Learn about Javascript
- Dry principle
- Use more about DOM

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for referencing. I really like going through reference to know the actual use of each html tag before using it.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an amazing website which helped me. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this anything web dev.
